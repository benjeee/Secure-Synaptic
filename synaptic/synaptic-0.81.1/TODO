Nice dpkg status output:
 - try to detect reads attempts of the child (via select() on _child_control?)
 - implement cancel as a last resort
 

Misc:
 - check download size against statvfs against /var/cache
   and in generate download script on the target location

 - preferences: HIG instant apply only(fast enough for e.g. pkglist changes?)
 - human readable repositories (ubuntu bug #1347)
 - proxy username/password does not work with synaptic preferences 
   (add apt PROXY_USER PROXY_PASSWORD style variables into a special
    expoert dialog in preferences)

 - Scroll-bug (Eric Freyens, 25.10.2004)
 - add "pause download" feature (possible with the fetchers?)
 - integrate apt-get.org/fedoratracker.org into synaptic (savannah bug
   #10544), a "server list" similar to amule (or gnutella, etc).
 - Mail von Vidar Haar (9.Aug.2004): neues summary layout/
   check for diskspace before downloading/executing
 - make log-file [done] with optinal dpkg-output logging

HIG-2 (thanks to Sebastian for his analysis):
 - "Force Version" should be a radiobutton not a combobox 
 - "View-menu"? > View
                > |-> Toolbar
	        > |-> Dock properties window
	        > |-> Reload
   (sucky?)
 - "find" -> "search" (and Ctrl->S shortcut, current Ctrl-s->Shift-Ctrl-S)
 - update task dialog ( http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/2.0/images/controls-list-checkbox.png)
  - "Custom fonts": use radio-buttons, not checkboxes
    >  o Use theme font
    >  x use this font [font sel]
  

 
User-Mode:
----------
 - split into user and root mode. User mode does all the changes and for
   the final installation runs (with gksu or libgksu): 
   # synaptic --set-selection --non-interactive --hide-main-window --dont-write-any-config
   ( --dont-write-any-config needs to be implemented)
   -> MOST infrastructure is there. 
      Problems: * set-version is not in selection file
                * all settings are in in $USER/.synaptic (use
                  --preserve-env?)
		* proxy settings and stuff needs to be preserved/passed 
		  "run-as-root synaptic"
   root is needed for:
      - update: could be solved by making the /var/lib/apt/lists/ dir
                group writeable for a desktop-group 
      - edit sources.list

 - Need far better state saving:
   - save selected distribution when doing a "save selection"
   - when using "force version" save this as well
   - when "open cache" is called, make sure that the correct distribution 
     is selected for save/restore

      
Misc:
-----
 - network proxy detection if gnome/kde is installed/run (can be
   solved with user-mode?!?)
 - re-enable "default remove action" in the preferences window
 - > > (synaptic:24143): Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkwidget.c: line 1827
   > > (gtk_widget_hide): assertion `GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed
   auf RPM
 - search in name+provides in search-dialog
 - In the change log view, link "bug" references to the actual bug report

Usability issues:
 - Rework repository and vendor dialog
 - Disable "Undo" and "Redo" if there is no action to perform
 - Think about implementing a summary of changes in the upgrade dialog
 - Use HIGified common dialogs (alignments and message text!)
 - Use a tree view for sections containing a separator "/" (e.g. SuSE, RedHat)
 - Merge the message about failed downloads and the "ignore failed downloads"
   dialog
 - Do not show "0 broken" and other "0" messages in the status bar
 - Use a warning or error icon in the status bar to get the users attention
   (e.g. in the case of broken packages)
 - Always show the progress bar in the main window and move it to left side
   (this is the default position in GNOME)
 - Make the status message more contextual: 
 	* show available upgrades after refresh
	* if there are broken packages, this is the only relevant message
 - Replace the "Running..." label in the "Apply changes" dialog with a
   progress bar and use a busy cursor (?)

Translation issues:
 - Use plural gettext in the status message

Unsorted:
 - possibility to resume failed installation of half installed packages
   Execute should be available if there are outstanding packages 
   (difficult!)
 - Please add hyperlink support in package info for example BTS entry
 - Please allow users to delete default filters and add an option to
   restore in prefs (or make them not deletable at all)
 - "crash handler" that automatically save the selections on a synaptic
   segfault (and present a dialog to reread them on the next start)
 - copy desktop file to the KDE menu - $KDEPREFIX/applnk/Settingsmenu
   "kde-config --prefix"
 - ask on debian-deity if it is possible to get a "DeletePin" function.
   this way, we can do default release pining without rereading the cache
   (see policy.cc:pkgPolicy::pkgPolicy())

Configure:
   - allways give the correct path in the synaptic.desktop file
     (currently hardcoded)

GUI:
   - Icons should be themable: gtkiconfactory
   - allow clicking in the depedency list so that the click takes
     you to the package
   - add native debconf reconfigure frontend using the cmdpipe interface
     to debconf (cool!)
   - try to get synaptic into base-config
   - add something that lets the user see if a certain package is already
     in the cache
   - add reduced view? (always ignore this package)
   - add ignore option for unwanted packages (use RPackageView?!)
   - add context menu in the dependency list to install/remove/upgrade
   - changesWindow should also support installing recommends/suggested pkgs
   - add a sources.list wizard for debian (like base-config)?

Filter:
   - add "immutable" filters that can be configured via /etc/synaptic/filters
   - dependencies of selected package
   - dependents of selected package

General:
   - add something like aptitude Last-change support, so that you can
     track what pkgs where installed to fullfill some dependencies
     (and have the option to remove them again automatically)
     [might be enough to use "remove with dependencies" ?]
   - make deporhan a native synaptic filter (should be easy)
   - implement raptoptions save/restore for getFlags/setFlags [not needed?]

Done: 
 - current task support is broken, try to fix it
 - add TaskView view to show tasks [done with tasksel window]
 - if download failed, use a special dialog to show it [done I think]
 - Add comments for translators [mostly done]

 - Pressing a key should jump to the first package with the same
   inital letter [fixed with gtk2.6]
 - Use new column editor in the preferences
 - Disable search button in the search dialog until an expresseion was entered
 - Separate sections from package list [can be archived with sorting
   for section]
 - "held back" is a bad term (ubuntu bug #1309)
 - think about how to simplify the "reload" step for new users
   (see mail from Philippe Cloutier, 16.Sep.2004)
   [package list outdated dialog takes care of this]
 - after changes in the repositories editor, ask for a update of
   the package list
 - download window scrollbar shouldn't always scroll, make two areas,
   one with active jobs and one with completted jobs?  (see mail from
   Adam Lydick, 20.10.2004)
 - Shortcut for force-version (for Redhat people)

   pkg (maybe do that every time the view is switched?)

 - do not use ithe same sentence for singular and plural in summary

   queued or no package is selected
 - split up the label_info (main window) into several labels

   installed (like ShowBroken() in apt-get.cc)

   (like apt-cache showpkg)
 - enable different sorting methods for the tree (e.g. size)
 - implement proxy settings 
 - implement a new (interactive) search function
 - config option what the default action of ("delete") button is
