synaptic (0.50-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Synaptic is no longer is build with "package hold" support. This used
  to be implemented using apt pins but debian apt maintainer says that
  this is not the right way (see #235841 for details). If you used to
  "hold" packages with synaptic, please remove the pins by editing 
  /etc/apt/preferences.

  Debtags support is no longer available but it will be readded once it's
  ported to the new code.

synaptic (0.48-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The format of the color configuration changed for version 0.48. This 
  means that if you have customized the colors in synaptic, you will 
  have to do it once again. Sorry for this inconvenience.

synaptic (0.41-1) unstable; urgency=low

  There is a additional package now called "synaptic-debtags" that can
  be installed instead of synaptic. This package includes support for
  the new "debtags" system that makes searching and displaying of the
  packages much more flexible. The package is a bit more experimental
  than plain synaptic and there is some work to be done, but IMHO it's
  very promising. More information about synaptic-debtags can be found 
  at /usr/share/doc/synaptic-debtags/README.debtags.

  More information about debtags in general is available at:
  http://deb-usability.alioth.debian.org/debtags/

  Thanks to Enrico Zini for implementing debtag support in synaptic
  and Erich Schubert for building the debtag database!

synaptic (0.40-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The debconf filter has changed. It is no longer a button in the status
  filter tab but a simple pattern filter ("<Inlcude> <depends on> 
  "debconf"). Because of this filters that use the "Not (no longer) 
  installable" status button will need to be rechecked by hand. Sorry 
  for the inconvenience.
