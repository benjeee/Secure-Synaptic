Some FAQs:

Q: Synaptic segfaults when I click on the "Repository" Window. I run Fedora
   Core1.
A: This may be caused by some ABI changes in used apt version. Please try
   to recompile synaptic and see if the problem goes away. If not, please
   mail us!


Q: How can I change the font in synaptic
A: 1. You are not running gnome:
   Edit your /root/.gtkrc-2.0 and add the following line:
   gtk-font-name = "Sans 14"

   2. You use gnome 2.x:
   Go to Applications/Desktop Preferences/Font and choose whatever you like.


Q: Synaptic crashes with the following messages:
   (synaptic:1316): Gdk-WARNING **: locale not supported by Xlib
   (synaptic:1316): ZVT-WARNING **: Cannot get required fonts from "monospace 13"  
   (synaptic:1316): ZVT-WARNING **: Failed to load any required font, so crash will  occur..check X11 font pathes and etc/pangox.alias file
   [crash]
A: This is most likley caused by incorrect locales. Try to set the locales
   with "dpkg-reconfigure locales" or set it to something like:
   $ export LC_ALL=it_IT
   or
   $ export LC_ALL=it_IT@euro
