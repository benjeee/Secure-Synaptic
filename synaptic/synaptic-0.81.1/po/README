Some strings in the po file do not need to be translated. They will never 
shown in the interface. They are in the .po file, because of some limitations
in glade (that means, it's not possible to mark certain strings as "don't
translate" in glade). So if you see strings like "label55", or "label_pkg"
or anything else that looks fishy, just ignore it. If in doubt contact me
or the mailinglist.

thanks,
 Michael
